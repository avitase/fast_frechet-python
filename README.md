**Find C++/SIMD/CUDA implementations of the algorithms [here][fast_frechet-cpp].**

This is Python package that provides a collection of different implementations for calculating the discrete [Fréchet distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance) between two polygonal curves.

As a baseline, referred to as [`vanilla`][vanilla], we implement the proposed algorithm by [Eiter and Manilla (1994)][vanilla].
Starting from here, we subsequently fix several of its shortcomings.
More precisely, 

1. [`vanilla`](fast_frechet/vanilla.py): The baseline implementation as proposed in [_Computing Discrete Fréchet Distance_ by T. Eiter and H. Mannila (1994)][vanilla]
1. [`no_recursion`](fast_frechet/no_recursion.py): A formulation w/o recursion.
1. [`vectorized`](fast_frechet/vectorized.py): A vectorized implementation that calculates the distance matrix within a single [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) call.
1. [`branchless`](fast_frechet/branchless.py): A variant w/o branches.
1. [`linear_memory`](fast_frechet/linear_memory.py): This formulation reduces the quadratic memory footprint to a linear one.
1. [`accumulate`](fast_frechet/accumulate.py): Formulation using a scan operation.
1. [`reduce_accumulate`](fast_frechet/reduce_accumulate.py): Formulation using a fold operation.
1. [`compiled`](fast_frechet/compiled.py): Variant of [`reduce_accumulate`](fast_frechet/reduce_accumulate.py) using the [Numba library](https://numba.pydata.org/) for JIT compilation of the innermost loop.

Implementations of all these variants can be found under [`fast_frechet/`](fast_frechet/) or by simply clicking on the listed names above.

## Installation

```bash
# production installation
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install fast_frechet

# development installation
$ pip install -e .[dev]
$ pre-commit install
```

## Usage

The snippet below estimates the Fréchet distance between the polygonal curves `p` and `q` using the Euclidean distance as a metric to measure distances between points:

```python
>>> from fast_frechet.linear_memory import frechet_distance

>>> p = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
>>> q = np.array([[2, 1], [3, 3], [5, 5]])

>>> frechet_distance(p, q, metric=lambda a, b: np.hypot(a[..., 0] - b[..., 0], a[..., 1] - b[..., 1]))
2.23606797749979
```

For invoking the [benchmark script](fast_frechet/__main__.py), run:

```bash
$ python fast_frechet
Length of trajectory = 1024

        no_recursion: 2303 ms
          vectorized:  553 ms
          branchless:  508 ms
       linear_memory:  348 ms
          accumulate:  286 ms
   reduce_accumulate:  282 ms
            compiled:   11 ms
```
(Note that we don't even try to benchmark the [`vanilla`](fast_frechet/vanilla.py) version here, as it already crashes for polygonal curves with a few hundred points due to its recursive nature.)
